# odin-recipes
The purpose of this projec is to buildbasic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes
We will make use of the stuff we've learned up to this point:
* Setup an index page
* Headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists
* Absolute and relative links
* Adding images to the site
* Stage and Commit changes to the github repo

When weâ€™re building your project, you will probably end up doing several git add + git commit cycles before being ready to push it up to GitHub with git push origin main
