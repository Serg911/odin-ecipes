        <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup chicken broth</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons butter or margerine</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>

     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>
            Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) 
            and select Saute function. Heat vegetable oil. 
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Season chicken thighs with salt and pepper on both sides; add to
            Instant Pot®. Cook one side at a time until both sides of the 
            chicken are a golden brown, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Remove 
            chicken from the pot and set aside.
        </li>

        <li>
            Add onion and sauté for 1 minute. Add garlic and cook for 1 more minute. 
            Pour in white wine and stir to scrape brown bits from the bottom of the 
            pot. Stir in chicken broth and lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook 
            until broth has reduced slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the Sauté function. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Return chicken Instant Pot®. Close and lock the lid. Select High pressure 
            according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 10 minutes. Allow 
            10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.
        </li>

        <li>
            Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's 
            instructions, for 10 minutes. Release remaining pressure carefully using the 
            quick-release method, about 5 minutes. Unlock and remove the lid. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Remove chicken from the pot and set aside. Select the Sauté mode and bring 
            sauce to a boil. Whisk in butter or margarine, heavy cream, salt, and thyme. 
            Cook until sauce has thickened slightly, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve chicken 
            drizzled with the sauce.
